# MÃ­mirsbrunn

mimir data import

## build

To build, you must first install rust:
```shell
curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh
```
and then build Mimirsbrunn:
```shell
cargo build --release
```

To use the Mimirsbrunn components you will need an elasticsearch database.

The elasticsearch version need to be >= 2.0

## test

To test simply launch:
```shell
cargo test
```
Integration tests are spawning one ElasticSearch docker, so you'll need a recent docker version.
Only one docker is spawn, so ES base has to be cleaned before each test.

To write a new test:
* write your test in a separate file in tests/
* add a call to your test in tests/tests.rs::test_all()
* pass a new ElasticSearchWrapper to your test method to get the right connection string for ES base
* the creation of this ElasticSearchWrapper automatically cleans ES base
  (you can also refresh ES base, clean up during tests, etc.)
