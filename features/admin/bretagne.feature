Feature: Baseline
	Some scenarios for testing admins in Britany, France.
	Part of the reason for britany is that it does not take too long to index
	into Elasticsearch.

	Background:
		Given osm file has been downloaded for bretagne
		And osm file has been processed by cosmogony for bretagne
		And cosmogony file has been indexed for bretagne

	# With 'Exact Match', we expect the query to be found at the top of the result because
	# the query exactly matches the name / label of the target
	# These queries are for varying levels of administrative regions (city, department, ...)
	Scenario Outline: Exact Match
		When the user searches for "<query>"
		Then he finds "<id>" as the first result

		Examples:
			| query             | id                        |
			| CÃ´tes-d'Armor     | admin:osm:relation:7398   |
		        | Loire-Atlantique  | admin:osm:relation:7432   |
			| Lorient           | admin:osm:relation:30305  |
			| Quimper           | admin:osm:relation:296095 |
